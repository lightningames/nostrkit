    <h1>What is NOSTRKIT?</h1>
    <h5>
        Nostr Kit is a versatile template project designed to simplify the
         creation of Nostr services for any domain. Nostr Kit provides a
         ready-to-use repository that can be easily cloned, allowing users
         to auto-generate their Nostr NIP-5 (Nostr Identifier Protocol)
         or Lightning addresses without the need for manual interventions
         like adding entries to the .well-known section of their websites
         or creating LNURLs.
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The features of Nostr Kit encompass creating a NIP-5 identifier
             (e.g., me@plebnet.dev) and a Lightning address via LNURLp on
             LNBits. Users also have the choice to redirect to their own 
             custom LNURL hosted on their personal node. Additionally, 
             the app allows users to include their email field following 
             the Lightning address specifications.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nostr Kit goes beyond just creating identifiers; it enables users
             to access a Nostr relay and facilitates inviting users to public
             Nostr chat rooms specific to their domains. To enhance the user
             experience, Nostr Kit seamlessly integrates LN (Lightning Network) 
             payments for any or all of the above functionalities, making the 
             payment process organization-specific. Users may also opt for renewal 
             payments, offering flexibility in subscription durations (e.g., monthly or yearly).
        </li>
        <li>
            For the backend services, Nostr Kit leverages LNBits and Nostr Relay 
            (utilizing the one in LNBits extension for small groups). It also 
            integrates Nostrchat, providing a communication platform for users. 
            The project aims to extend the integration of Nostrchat with platforms 
            like Discord or Telegram by creating bridges.

            The reference section provides essential links, including Nostr protocol NIPs, 
            Nostr key-to-DNS mapping, encrypted DM specifications, and public chat guidelines. 
            Users can leverage the LNURL specification, LightningAddress.com, and Bolt 11 
            specification for further insights.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the future, Nostr Kit envisions additional features, such as backend Primal 
            caching services as a paid user option, allowing users to manage memberships efficiently.

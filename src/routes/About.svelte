    <h1>About NOSTRKIT</h1>
    <h5>
        Nostr Kit is an innovative initiative that streamlines the creation of 
        personalized Nostr services for any domain. Our project revolves around 
        a convenient template repository that is readily accessible for cloning. 
        With Nostr Kit, you can effortlessly generate your own Nostr NIP-5 and 
        Lightning addresses, eliminating the need for manual entries in the 
        .well-known section of your website or the creation of LNURLs.

            Our 1-page web application caters to your specific domain needs. You can 
            easily customize various options to suit your preferences, and we ensure 
            that your choices don't interfere with each other. If you lack a Nostr 
            public key (npub) or Nostr secret key (nsec), don't worry â€“ we'll help you 
            generate one seamlessly.

            Embracing user-friendliness, Nostr Kit empowers you to create a NIP-5 identifier 
            (e.g., me@plebnet.dev) and a lightning address via LNURLp on LNBits. Additionally, 
            you have the flexibility to redirect to your personalized LNURL hosted on your 
            personal node. To provide a holistic experience, our app includes an email field 
            in compliance with Lightning address specifications.

            Beyond mere identifiers, Nostr Kit unlocks the potential to access a Nostr relay 
            and participate in public Nostr chat rooms within your domain. Payments are made 
            easier with our integrated LN (Lightning Network) payment options, tailored to your 
            organization's needs. You can even choose renewal payments based on your preferred 
            subscription intervals, be it monthly or yearly.

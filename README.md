# NostrKit README

## **The WHAT:**

This Project is a Template Build. The end goal: to be able to make this repo a template and let people clone it for their own version. Right now, its not a template, but it should be easily convertible in the settings when finished.

## **The WHY:**

Why are we doing this? Because a lot of nostr + LN services are split all over the place and there isn't a good way to do it all in one shot. What we've outlined here is a starting point. There are many other nostr services which will be added in the future not yet listed, so plan accordingly,

## **Do's and Don'ts**

- DO NOT HARD CODE ANYTHING
- DO Think about smart abstractions
- DO Think about usability
- DO Think about simplicity
- DO Think about designing for the future.

## **The FRAMEWORKS:**

- Svelte and Node.js

## **The GUIDELINES:**

- Use Picocss v2 as the CSS and for forms - https://v2.picocss.com/docs

- This nostrkit website should be deployable on any domain-name.github.io, or vercel or netlify (custom domains)

- NIP-5, LNURL, and lightning address is as easy as creating a .well-known in the public directory and deploying it immediately. This means that

- End goal is to create a template so easy that someone who doesn't know how to code can just click on 'use template' and then it will create everything they need for a domain with NIP-5, lightning address, email forwarder.

- Allow ability for user to host the nostrkit website on a subdomain but have it update .well-known in another github repo which might be the actual domain website (e.g. plebnet website is the main domain, so the .well-known is on another github repo). [this is probably the trickiest]

- For example nostrkit website might be called https://services.domain.com but the actual website is at https://domain.com, so their NIP would be name@domain.com, which means that the .well-known must be hosted over at the repo that is used for domain.com

- Allow ability for any one to visit the nostrkit website and create their own username@domain.com and then pay a small lightning invoice fee to get it added.

- Allow user to generate a nostr npub/nsec (free service)
- Allow user to pay for selected items only, e.g.
  - Allow user to generate a vanity npub/nsec (lightning fee) [see what Edward Snowden did, but grunch/rana (see git repo) might be too intensive to run on web, not sure if there is a web api version or if there something else, side project anybody? take rana and make it a web enabled service? need server. pls research to check if there is something else out there first before coding it - stretch challenge - turn it into a docker container that can be deployed on fly.io and see if its enough computational power to run on the free plan]
  - Nostr NIP-5
  - lightning address only pointing at their personal lightning node, or
  - lightning address with a LNBIts account [Bitkarrot will give you a LNBits server] created and/or
  - lightning address with email forwarder to their personal email
  - purchase access to nostr relay (future, don't have it right now, but plan now to make it an option)

## **Using this Repo:**

1. Git clone and cd into `nostrkit`.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the local server
4. Run `npm run build` to create an optimized production version to be hosted on a domain of your choosing (Vercel and Github Pages are good places to start)
